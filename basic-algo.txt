1. Collect info about HDD. Scan every sector and calculate every tiny free space in every sector that are shown as full (but not actually full).

2. Make detailed addresses for every piece of hard drive and put it into an array.

3. turn every input (data) and turn it into a binary format and remember the original format. or scan as a raw format (0 and 1)

4. Separate every bit and put into an array.

5. Create a Hash (key/value)

6. Update the Hash like this ( key=array[x]) (value=[address])

7. use the hash to write every bit in its suitable address in Hard Drive.

8. if data is asked: retrieve the bits using addresses and put them in order using that array[x].
